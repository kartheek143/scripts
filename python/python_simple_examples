expession exercises:

1) write an expression to caluculate the number of minutes in day.

minutes = 60
hours = 24
day = minutes * hours
print (day)

2) wite an expression to caluclate the number of second in a day?

minutes = 60
hours = 24
second = 60
day = hours * minutes * second
print (day)

for loop expressions:
1) print the even number up to 10 (2 4 6 8 10 ) using loop.

for i in range(2,11,2):
  print (i)

2) print the first 10 numbers in revers

for i in range(10,0,-1):
  print (i)

3) print the first 10 even numbers in revers

for i in range (20,1,-2):
  print (i)

4)print the square of firt 10 numbers?

for i in range (1,11):
  x=i ** 2
  print (x)

5) print the square of firt 10 numbers? in revers

for i in range (10,0,-1):
  x=i ** 2
  print (x)


Methods Exercise:
1)Write a mothod call print_hello_worl_thrice(). 
It should print " Hello world" thrice to the output. define this method,
and also invoke it.

def prin_hello_world_thrice(num=3):
  for i in range(1,num+1):
    print ("hellow world")

prin_hello_world_thrice()


2) write a method called print_numbers(), that would
	- print all successive integers form 1 to n,
	- print squares of all successive integers form 1 to n.

def print_numbers(num=5):
  for i in range(1,num+1):
  	print (i)
  	print (i ** i)

print_numbers()

3) write a method which takes as input two integers, representing 
two angles of a triangle, and computes the third angle.
